\section{Introduction}
Up to now we have seen that there are different models for~$(\infty,1)$\dash categories. The models we have discussed so far are quasicategories, relative categories using simplicial localisation, Segal categories and complete Segal spaces. These are all models for the general theory of~$(\infty,1)$\dash categories. One could restrict himself on the other hand to certain subclasses of~$(\infty,1)$\dash categories. An important example of this phenomenon are model categories, which provide a model for certain~$(\infty,1)$\dash categories that are both complete and cocomplete. Whether they can model \emph{all} complete and cocomplete~$(\infty,1)$\dash categories is not known.

Another possible subclass of~$(\infty,1)$\dash categories is the one modelled using differential graded categories. These were originally introduced to solve issues with triangulated categories, and they have already found many applications outside the world of~$(\infty,1)$\dash categories. They are so called ``linear'' models, in the same sense that homological algebra is a linear version of homotopical algebra.

Whereas topological or simplicial categories are categories enriched over topological spaces or simplicial sets, a differential graded category is a category enriched over chain complexes of~$k$\dash modules, for~$k$ a commutative ring. So we restrict ourselves from~$\infty$\dash groupoids to so called abelian and fully strict~$\infty$\dash groupoids, these are exactly the~$\infty$\dash groupoids modelled by chain complexes\expandthis{more context}.

The goal of this expos\'e is to
\begin{enumerate}
  \item introduce dg~categories;
  \item discuss the model category structures on the category of dg~categories;
  \item give some applications of this machinery;
  \item explain how this fits into derived algebraic geometry.
\end{enumerate}
